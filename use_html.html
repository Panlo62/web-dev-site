      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers
        receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.<br />HTML elements are the building
        blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
        provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
        and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
        angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page<br />.HTML can embed programs written
        in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
        and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
        of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
        the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

      <div>
        <p>
          A HTML document consists of two parts: DOCTYPE declaration and
          document tree. DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser which version of
          HTML are you using. Document tree consists of HTML elements that
          define content and structure of web page. &lt; html &gt; is the root
          element which marks the end and the begining of the HTML document
          tree.<br /><br />Here's a standard HTML document tree which is used in
          almost every HTML document.

      <h2 id="inline_block">HTML Tags - Inline and Block</h2>
      <p>
        HTML tags or elements are basically divided into two types depending on
        how they are visualised and depicted inherently without the use of CSS.
        These are inline elements and block elements.
      </p>
      <div class="inline">
        <h4>Inline Elements</h4>
        <p>
          An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only
          takes up as much width as necessary.<br />Commonly used inline
          elements: &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;input&gt;
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h4>Block Elements</h4>
        <p>
          A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
          automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
          A block-level element always takes up the full width available.<br />Commonly
          used block elements: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;header&gt;,
          &lt;table&gt;
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 id="nesting">Nesting Tags</h2>
      <p>
        Nesting tags is quite an important and fundamental skill when it comes
        to HTML. It is like a box in a bigger box. When you nest tags then you
        need to close the tag first which was opened first otherwise
        complications will occur.<br />Moreover, you can use inline level
        elements inside a block level element but you cannot insert a block
        level element inside a block element except for the &lt; div &gt;.
        Inline level elements can be inserted anywhere.<br />Nested tables and
        nested lists are quite common in web pages and you need to properly nest
        the tags to make the CSS work properly as well for screen readers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="attr">Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        Attributes are used along with the tags to specify some of its
        additional properties and changes how it is displayed. With each
        attribute, you usually give it a value defining what is to be done for
        example for an image you give the image url in the src attribute of &lt;
        img &gt; tag.<br />There are also attributes which do not require any
        value. Such attributes are called <strong>boolean attributes</strong>.
        These attributes work when they are written otherwise their value is
        false. For example, in &lt; input &gt; tag, <i>required</i> is a boolean
        attribute which when written specifies that the input is compulsory for
        that field before submitting.
