        and you will see the results.<br />This is a website where we try to
        make you understand about web development and teach you some tips and
        tricks about creating your own website. We will not be covering each and
        every aspect of web development but you will learn enough to be able to
        create your own website. Yes, your very first website! Although, it
        might not be as good as you would expect it to be.<br />In case you want

      <h2 id="webd">What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p>
        Web development refers to the work involved in developing a website for
        the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to dynamic web pages, complex web applications, electronic
        businesses, and social network services. Professionals usually refer to
        "Web development" as the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
        writing markup and coding.<br />Web development involves Web
        engineering, Web designing, Web content development, client liaison,
        client-side or server-side scripting, Web server and network security
        configuration, and e-commerce development. To create a full-proof
        secured and presentable website, you need a team of professionals
        ranging from designers, content makers to security specialists. The goal
        of making a website is not only to just present it to the user but to
        make the user interact with the site facilitating easy communication and
        better functionality.

      <h2 id="spec">Web Development Specializations</h2>
      <p>
        Web development professionals are mainly divided in three parts
        depending on the type of work they do: <em>Front-end developer</em>,
        <em>Back-end developer</em>, and <em>Full-stack developer</em>.
      </p>
      <div class="types">
        <div class="front-end">
          <h4>Front-end development</h4>
          <p>
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is
            the practice of producing the front end for a website or Web
            Application. It defines how a website appear to the user.<br />Common
            languages used: HTML, CSS, React, Angular, Javascript, jQuery
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="back-end">
          <h4>Back-end development</h4>
          <p>
            Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It
            focuses on databases, scripting and website architecture. It
            contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any
            action on a website.<br />Common languages used: C#, Golang, PHP,
            SQL, Python, Ruby
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="full-stack">
          <h4>Full-stack development</h4>
          <p>
            A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client
            and server software.<br />In addition to mastering HTML and CSS,
            he/she also knows how to program a browser (like using JavaScript),
            program a server (like using PHP) and program a database (like using
            SQL).

        />&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML - HyperText Markup Language
      </h2>
      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers
        receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.<br />HTML elements are the building
        blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML
        provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
        and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
        angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page<br />.HTML can embed programs written
        in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
        and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
        of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
        the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

          height="100px"
          class="csslogo"
        />&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation
        and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
        improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
        content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
        speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br />Separation
        of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
        markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
        on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br />The
        name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS
        specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

        />&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript
      </h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
        one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
        webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
        web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
        users' devices.<br />JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time
        compiled language. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM). It also supports many event driven
        functionalities.<br />JavaScript engines were originally used only in
        web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety
        of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is
        Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and
        respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
        greatly in design.
