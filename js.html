            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402).</p>
            <h2 id="js_java">Javascript Vs Java programming language</h2>
            <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use. Java applications can run in any virtual machine(JVM) or browser. JavaScript code used to run only in the browser, but now it can run on the server via Node.js. Java is a strongly typed language and variables must be declared first to use in the program. In Java, the type of a variable is checked at compile-time.	JavaScript is a loosely typed language and has a more relaxed syntax and rules.</p><br>
            <h2 id="use">How is it Used?</h2>
            <div style="font-size:110%;">
            <p>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left:5%;">
                    <li style="padding-top:1%;"><strong>Internal JavaScript:</strong> We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the &lt; script &gt; tag. The &lt; script &gt; tag can either be placed inside the &lt; head &gt; or the &lt; body &gt; tag according to the requirement.</li>
                    <li style="padding-top:1%;"><strong>External JavaScript File:</strong> We can create a file with .js extension and paste the JS code inside it. After creating the file, add this file in &lt; script src="file_name.js" &gt; tag inside &lt; head &gt; tag of the HTML file.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><p>Basic syntax:</p>
                <strong>
                <pre style="background-color: rgb(209,209,209); width:20vw;">
                    &lt; script &gt;
                            //JScode
                    &lt;/script &gt;
                </pre>
                </strong>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2 id="Why">Why is JavaScript Used?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language for both client-side and server-side to make interactive web pages. It is mainly used to develop websites and web-based applications. Creating Interactive Websites: JavaScript is used to make the web pages dynamic and interactive. It means using JavaScript, we can change the web page content and styles dynamically. Building Applications: JavaScript is used to make web and mobile applications. To build the web and mobile apps, we can use most popular JavaScript frameworks like â€“ ReactJS, React Native, Node.js etc. Web Servers: We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers. Game Development: JavaSCript can be used to design Browser games. In JavaScript, lots of game engines available that provide frameworks for building games.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="other_uses">Other Uses</h2>
            <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). It also supports many event driven functionalities. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
